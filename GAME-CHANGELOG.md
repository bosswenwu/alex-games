## 2026-09-25 — Multi-game design improvements

**Scope:** Updated six games. 沙海奇境 (`games/minecraft/`) was explicitly excluded and not modified.

| Game | Player-visible change | Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 深渊圣所 | Added the rare 裂潮棱片 relic. A successful dash triggers a cyan shockwave that can damage up to six nearby enemies; pulse count is exposed through the debug state. | `games/abyss/assets/deep-content.js` |
| HAVEN | Added deterministic desert oasis generation with a spring, sandstone shore, palms, HUD identification, and debug lookup. Existing block IDs and save format are unchanged. | `games/haven/haven.js` |
| 星际突围 | Added paired muzzle flashes and a brief ship recoil while firing; overdrive changes the flash color. Exposed the effect state through the debug API. | `games/nebula/index.html` |
| 钢铁前线 | Added enemy firing telegraphs: a dashed aim line and a pulsing player warning ring near shot release. Documented the new debug fields. | `games/tank-strike/index.html`, `games/tank-strike/README.md`, `games/tank-strike/SPEC.md` |
| 三国塔防 | Selected attack towers show their range, in-range enemies, and the current target/priority with a lock-on overlay. Exposed target information through the debug API. | `games/three-kingdoms/index.html` |
| 竹知了 | Added short-lived airflow ripple feedback driven by player input, including at low rotor speeds; exposed wake strength through the debug API. | `games/zhuzhiliao/index.html` |

**Verification recorded for this change:**

- All six game owners performed targeted checks; reported checks include browser gameplay/API state changes, desktop/mobile layout checks, and no observed browser console errors.
- HAVEN reported 287 self-tests passed and 0 failed, plus deterministic seeded oasis generation.
- JavaScript syntax checks passed for the changed HAVEN and 深渊圣所 scripts; `git diff --check` passed for the combined change.
- Direct device touch and screenshot inspection were not available for every game; see the owning agent's verification notes if further detail is needed.

**Delivery:** Commit `7053c43` (`feat(games): enrich combat feedback and exploration variety`) was pushed to `origin/main`.
